## Doxygen

Doxygen is the tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources. It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML). The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code. [Detailed description](Common/doxygen.md)
